# ChirsXuLab: SC-XGB Flood Scheduling Dataset

This repository contains the training, validation, and testing datasets for the SC-XGB_Model, developed for intelligent 
scheduling rule extraction in reservoir-lake flood control systems. 
The model is based on the paper:
"Spatiotemporal Correction of Decision Variables using XGBoost for Multi-objective Intelligent Scheduling Rule Extraction in Reservoir-lake Flood Control Systems."

# File Descriptions
# Input Files

(1) Input_Train_Design flood scenarios_sc-xgb.xlsx  
  Optimized scheduling samples derived from design flood scenarios, used to train and validate the SC-XGB_Model.

(2) Input_Test_Historical flood scenarios_sc-xgb.xlsx
  Historical flood scenario data used as the testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of the model.

# Output Files

(3) Output1_sc-xgb_predictions_Train.xlsx
  Predicted reservoir and lake outflows generated by the SC-XGB model during training.

(4) Output2_sc-xgb_prediction_Test.xlsx
  Predicted outflows generated by the model during testing with historical flood events.

# Historical Scenario Samples

Six historical flood events used for testing model performance and generalization:

| TestData_historical flood scenario of 20160615.xlsx           | 50-year return period    |
| TestData_historical flood scenario of 20180803.xlsx           | 15-year return period    |
| TestData_historical flood scenario of 20200706.xlsx           | 100-year return period   |
| TestData_historical flood scenario of 20210710.xlsx           | 5-year return period     |

 These data samples are used to validate the modelâ€™s applicability, robustness, and scalability under different hydrological conditions.

# Notes

- The SC-XGB_Model.py script used to generate these predictions is available in a separate repository:https://github.com/ChrisXuLab303/SC-XGB-Model.git.
- Input features include inflows, storage, and decision variables relevant to multi-objective flood control optimization.
- Output predictions include reservoir and lake outflows under learned scheduling rules.
